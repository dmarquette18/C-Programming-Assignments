# C-Programming-Assignments
A collection of assignment files I did in the C language during Undergraduate at Northwestern. 

Information about each individual assignment can be found at the top of the program commented out.

Some files are project descriptions, these files code were located on a school server that I am now unable to access, however I provide the assignent description along with grade recieved to give context on my C coding experience.
